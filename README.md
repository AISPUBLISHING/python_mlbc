Simply open the Jupyter notebooks you are interested in:
* Option 1: Using jupyter.org's notebook viewer. Github.com's notebook viewer also works but it is slower and the math formulas are not displayed correctly.
* Option 2: cloning this repository and running Jupyter locally. This option lets you play around with the code. In this case, follow the installation instructions below.
* Best Option: Download the notebooks and use Google Colab https://colab.research.google.com or Jupyter Notebook available in ANACONDA.

## Installation
First, you will need to install git, if you don't have it already.
Next, clone this repository by opening a terminal and typing the following commands:
$ cd $HOME  # or any other development directory you prefer 
$ git clone https://github.com/AISCIENCES/pdsmlb.git 
$ cd dlf-python 
If you do not want to install git, you can instead download master.zip, unzip it, rename the resulting directory to dlf-python and move it to your development directory.
