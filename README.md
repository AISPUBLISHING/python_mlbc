Simply open the Jupyter notebooks you are interested in:
* Option 1: Using jupyter.org's notebook viewer. Github.com's notebook viewer also works but it is slower and the math formulas are not displayed correctly.
* Option 2: cloning this repository and running Jupyter locally. This option lets you play around with the code. In this case, follow the installation instructions below.
* Best Option: Download the notebooks and use Google Colab https://colab.research.google.com or Jupyter Notebook available in ANACONDA.
